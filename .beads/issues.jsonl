This avoids confusion when interoperating with NNG.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All 6 protocol PRDs updated\n- [ ] \"SP\" replaced with \"Waggle\" throughout\n- [ ] Consistent terminology with VISION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md\n- [ ] Technical specifications preserved exactly\n- [ ] All PlantUML diagrams updated","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-05T09:53:29.967361-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-05T09:53:29.967361-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"sp-igh.4","depends_on_id":"sp-igh","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-05T09:53:29.968964-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"},{"issue_id":"sp-igh.4","depends_on_id":"sp-igh.1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-05T09:53:29.970637-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"},{"issue_id":"sp-igh.4","depends_on_id":"sp-igh.2","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-05T09:53:29.972451-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic"}]}
